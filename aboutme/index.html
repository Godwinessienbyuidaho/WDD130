         I am married to my beautiful eternal companion -Blessing though i prefer calling her sweet-pea.
         I love biking, reading, being part of my stake choir and singing with my sweet-pea. 
    <p>I am currently a student of BYUI pursuing my degree in Web and computer development and i enjoy already every bit of 
        of the lesson am receiving.
    I chosed to continue my study with BYUI because of the simple and easy-to-understand lesson structure that is put 
    in place 
to help students become acemically successful. I hope to be able to use my knowledge to gain a good paying job in order to
be able to provide for my family the basic necesities of life. </p>
