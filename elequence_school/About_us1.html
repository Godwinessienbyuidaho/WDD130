            <h2>Tuition / payment. </h2>
            <p id="p2">In eloquence schools we’ve got you covered in terms of tuition so you don’t have to be bothered. We have plans that allows you to pay for your child’s tuition installmentally. This way you have more time to pay and less money to pay at a time.
                Payment of tuition. In eloquence schools you can make your payment in cash or through bank transfer. If you are making a cash payment remember you do not have to worry about making full payment at a time you can pay by installment. When paying by installment, note that the deadline for all payment is at the middle of the term. If by the middle of the term your child tuition has not been paid in full, your child stand a chance of losing his or her privilege as a student in our esteemed school.
                Payment for learning and workshop materials. Please note that in Eloquence School, payment for learning and workshop materials comes first. What this means that no matter the mode of tuition payment for a child, the payment that parents make firstly is for the workshop and learning materials. No tuition will be accepted only until the workshop and learning materials has been paid for in full.
